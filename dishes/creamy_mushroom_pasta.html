    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

      <li>Spaghetti or pasta of choice</li>
      <li>Mushrooms</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dice up the mushrooms into bite sized pieces and set aside. Start cooking
        up the pasta while you also warm up a seperate pan to cook the sauce in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the mushrooms into a pan with some olive oil and allow to sautee for
        10 minutes or until you are happy with the amount of size reduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic to the mushrooms and allow to incorporate for 30 seconds.
        Add in the vegetable stock and allow the sauce to reduce to a
        consistancy that you are happy with. I recommend 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Add in the cooked pasta and allow
        to incorporate for a few minutes. Allow the sauce to stick to the pasta
        and then add in the parmesean.
      </li>
    </ol>
