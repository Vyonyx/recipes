    <ol>
      <li>
        Dice up the onions, carrots and celery into small pieces. Heat up a large
        pot to low - medium heat and put the diced onions in. Sweat out the onions
        unitl they are translucent and then add the diced carrots and celery in.
        Continue to cook these 3 ingredients on low to medium heat for at least
        20 minutes, though the longer the better to caramelise the vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the vegetables have been caramelised to your liking, remove them
        from the pan and put in all of your minced meat. Cook it until the meat
        is completely browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put some minced garlic and tomato paste into the meat mixture and let
        the flavour's incorporate. Afterwards, add the caramelised mixture back
        in and incorporate the flavours further. Add in a can of tomatoes and
        the beef stock and let simmer for as long as you can (minimum 30 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        After the pieces of tomato have disintigrated in size and the sauce has
        reduced and thickened, season the mixtue to taste and combine with cooked
        spaghetti to complete the dish.
